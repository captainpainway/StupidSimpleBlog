#Stupid Simple Blog Generator

I wanted a very simple static site generator customized with only what I want and need. This is the bare-bones version of that site generator.

To use: Clone the repo. Put markdown files in the Posts directory, using the markdown template in the Templates folder. Run npm start to create static pages. I use http-server to serve the files from the static directory for preview. Upload the static folder to the /var/www/html/ directory on your server and you're done.
